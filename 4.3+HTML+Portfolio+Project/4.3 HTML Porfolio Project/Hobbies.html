        <p>Shut up and take my money! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. But I've never been to the moon! No, she'll probably make me do it. Ummm…to eBay? Why would I want to know that? And I'm his friend Jesus. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Bite my shiny metal ass. Really?! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Bite my shiny metal ass. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>

        <p>1 November, evening.--No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night.</p>
